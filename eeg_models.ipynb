We strongly recommend using this\n","    architecture as it performs much better and has nicer properties than\n","    our earlier version. For example:\n","        \n","        1. Depthwise Convolutions to learn spatial filters within a \n","        temporal convolution. The use of the depth_multiplier option maps \n","        exactly to the number of spatial filters learned within a temporal\n","        filter. This matches the setup of algorithms like FBCSP which learn \n","        spatial filters within each filter in a filter-bank. This also limits \n","        the number of free parameters to fit when compared to a fully-connected\n","        convolution. \n","        \n","        2. Separable Convolutions to learn how to optimally combine spatial\n","        filters across temporal bands. Separable Convolutions are Depthwise\n","        Convolutions followed by (1x1) Pointwise Convolutions. \n","        \n","    \n","    While the original paper used Dropout, we found that SpatialDropout2D \n","    sometimes produced slightly better results for classification of ERP \n","    signals. However, SpatialDropout2D significantly reduced performance \n","    on the Oscillatory dataset (SMR, BCI-IV Dataset 2A). We recommend using\n","    the default Dropout in most cases.\n","        \n","    Assumes the input signal is sampled at 128Hz. If you want to use this model\n","    for any other sampling rate you will need to modify the lengths of temporal\n","    kernels and average pooling size in blocks 1 and 2 as needed (double the \n","    kernel lengths for double the sampling rate, etc). Note that we haven't \n","    tested the model performance with this rule so this may not work well. \n","    \n","    The model with default parameters gives the EEGNet-8,2 model as discussed\n","    in the paper.

We haven't extensively tested other values of this\n","    parameter (say, F2 < F1 * D for compressed learning, and F2 > F1 * D for\n","    overcomplete).
